# heatmap-based-landmarker
Try to reproduce work of `Heatmap Regression via Randomized Rounding` https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00225.
 + Use some code on https://github.com/baoshengyu/H3R
 + Use some code and discussion in https://github.com/baoshengyu/H3R/issues/6 . mostly contributed by `ElteHupkes`
 + Some insight in here https://elte.me/2021-03-10-keypoint-regression-fastai#random-rounding-and-high-resolution-net . Thanks `ElteHupkes`
alot for helping.
